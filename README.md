# RediSolar for Node.js

# Introduction

This is the sample application codebase for RU102JS, [Redis for JavaScript Developers](https://university.redislabs.com/courses/ru102js/) at [Redis University](https://university.redislabs.com).

Solutions to the course programming challenges can be found on the `solutions` branch.

# Prerequisites

In order to start and run this application, you will need:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (8.9.4 or newer, we recommend using the current Long Term Stable version)
* npm (installed with Node.js)
* Access to a local or remote installation of [Redis](https://redis.io/download) version 5 or newer (local preferred)
* If you want to try the RedisTimeSeries exercises, you'll need to make sure that your Redis installation also has the [RedisTimeSeries Module](https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries/) installed

# Setup

To get started:

```
$ npm install
```

# Configuration 

The application uses a configuration file, `config.json` to specify the port that it listens 
on plus some logging parameters and how it connects to a database.  

The supplied `config.json` file is already set up to use Redis on localhost port 6379.  Change these values if your Redis instance is on another host or port, or requires a password to connect.

```
{
  "application": {
    "port": 8081,
    "logLevel": "debug",
    "dataStore": "redis"
  },
  "dataStores": {
    "redis": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 6379,
      "password": null,
      "keyPrefix": "ru102js"
    }
  }
}
```

The `keyPrefix` for Redis is used to namespace all the keys that the application generates or 
references.  So for example a key `sites:999` would be `ru102js:sites:999` when written to Redis.

# Load Sample Data

To load sample site data and sample metrics, run:

```
npm run load src/resources/data/sites.json flushdb
```

`flushdb` is optional, and will erase ALL data from Redis before inserting the sample data.

The application uses the key prefix `ru102js` by default, so you should be able to use the 
same Redis instance for this application and other data if necessary.

# Development Workflow

In order to speed up development, you can run the application using `nodemon`, so that any 
changes to source code files cause the server to reload and start using your changes.

```
npm run dev
```

Edit code, application will hot reload on save.

If you want to run without `nodemon`, use:

```
npm start
```

But you will then need to stop the server and restart it when you change code.

# Accessing the Front End Web Application

You should be able to see the front end solar dashboard app at: 

```
http://localhost:8081/
```

# Running Tests

The project is setup to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) for testing.  To run all tests:

```
npm test
```

To run a specific suite of tests (e.g. those in `tests/basic.test.js`):

```
npm test -t basic
```

To run Jest continuously in watch mode, which gives you access to menus allowing you to run 
subsets of tests and many more options:

```
npm testdev
```

# Linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with a slightly modified version of the 
[Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

* The file `.eslintrc` contains a short list of rules that have been disabled for this project.
* The file `.eslintignore` contains details of paths that the linter will not consider when 
linting the project.

To run the linter:

```
npm run lint
```
